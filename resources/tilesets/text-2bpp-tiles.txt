Monospace 8x16px font and border tiles.

I started with the 8x8 pixel font from my untech-engine unit tests (that I made ages ago) and:
 * Vertically scaled them to 11 pixels tall with Aseprite.
 * Manually shrunk most of the characters from 7 to 6 pixels wide.
 * Centered the tiles.
 * Increased the width of most of the strokes to 2 pixels.
 * Cleaned up the corners.
 * Cleaned up the tails of the lower case letters.
 * Redrew the 4, 9 and 0 characters.
 * Cleaned up half of the symbols.
 * Redrew the other half the symbols.
 * Added a cursor symbol.
 * Rearranged the order of the characters to match ASCII.
